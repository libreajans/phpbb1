Thank you for choosing phpBB as your forum software. 

An install of phpBB should be very painless. First you will need
the following.

1 Webserver w/PHP 3.0.15 or greater  (Apache is know to work very well with phpBB)
1 MySQL server (phpBB has been tested on 3.22 and 3.23)
1 Admin crazy enough to run a forum (That would be you :) )

Installation
------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: If you are running a Windows machine please skip down to the 'Notes
for installing phpBB on Windows systems runing Apache' Section! If you have 
problems with a Windows install you will be reffered to this document 
befor any other support is given!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Untar the soure into the directory phpBB will run from. Seeing as you
are reading this file you have probably gotten that far. (Or if you are on a
different machine then your webserver FTP the resulting phpBB dir over to where
it will run from on the server. ie /www/yourdomain.com/phpBB)

Step 2: Edit config.php and change the following values:
$url_images = "http://$SERVER_NAME/phpBB/images"; 
$url_phpbb = "http://$SERVER_NAME/phpBB"; 
$url_admin = "http://$SERVER_NAME/phpBB/admin"; 

$cookiedomain = "www.yourdomain.com";
$cookiename = "phpBB";
$cookiepath = "/phpBB";
$cookiesecure = false;

The $url_* fields may work for you if you're running phpBB from a domain 
like this: http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB

However if you access phpBB like this: http://www.domain.com/~you/phpBB you will 
have to change these values.

Also, config.php MUST be writeable by the webserver or the install will fail.
To set this on UNIX systems you can use chmod
ie: chmod 777 config.php (after the install if finsished set it back to 755 
via chmod 755 config.php so it can't be written by anyone again.)

Step 3: Edit extention.inc and set $phpEx to the extention of all your phpBB files.
ie. if all your files end in .php then extention.inc would include

$phpEx = "php";

DO NOT put the . in.

Step 4: Run install.php by going to http://www.youdomain.com/phpBB/install.php

Step 5: Go to the admin panel and setup your categories, 
forums, ranks, etc etc.

Thats it. You should now have a working installation of phpBB.

Notes for installing phpBB on Windows Systems running Apache.

First, thanks to our Windows using bug hunter David Tod Sigafoos for
coming up with this solution.

phpBB will only function correctly when PHP4 is installed as an ISAPI Apache
module, here are instuctions for installing it as such:

1) Stop your apache server

2) Download php 4.0.3pl1 from php.net.  Download the isapi version
from here http://www.php.net/downloads.php

3) Unzip php into your directory (for me it was c:\php)

4) Copy the php4ts.dll into the windows\system directory.  (there
should only be one in system or system32)

In http.conf

5) In apache http.conf find the loadmodule section and add this line
LoadModule php4_module c:/php/sapi/php4apache.dll

6) Be sure you have the AddType for php

If you have any other problems installing on Windows please visit the
support forums at http://www.phpbb.com/phpBB/
